# Vigieau for home-assistant

Component to expose water restrictions in France through Vigieau api. See https://vigieau.gouv.fr/ for web access.

This integration share location via a 3rd party (government) website (as the website does).

Data is based on the [propluvia](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnee-secheresse-propluvia/#/resources) dataset. It's really great to have access to such data.

## Installation

It must be used as a custom repository via hacs.

## Configuration

Once the custom integration has been added, add "vigieau" integration through the UI.

You can choose the location either by using HA coordinates (default), precise town using Zip Code or select a point in a map

HA coordinates are the one defined during initial setup and accessible using Système>Général>Modifier l'emplacement)

Once a location is added a new one can be added using another location method.

### Using Zip Code
![image info](/img/location.png)

Localisation is based on INSEE Code, not ZIP.To one ZIP, it may correspond many INSEE, in this case city selection is required to get correct and single data.

## Known issues and workaround

### Error communicating with API: Impossible to find approximate address of the current HA instance. API returned no result.

This integration uses a geocoding API to get the city code from INSEE (used as a input by Vigieau API). It is based on governement data which is still incomplete in some France areas.

A workaround can be used by setting the `VIGIEAU_FORCED_INSEE_CITY_CODE` environment variable with the city code as value.
⚠ Value of city code is not necessarily city "postal code". You can find it easily of wikipedia under the name [code commune](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_officiel_g%C3%A9ographique#Code_commune).
